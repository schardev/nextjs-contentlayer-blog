## Motive

I created this blog template just as a learning experience (and to get my hands dirty) with [Next.js' new shiny app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). I also wanted few specific reusable functionalities for my personal portfolio blog that I can also easily copy-paste to my other projects. Developing a generic template seemed like a better way of achieving that.

## Features

- Built with mobile-first approach
- Highly customisable and flexible
- Easier customisations using CSS variables
- Keyboard accessible
- Light and Dark mode support
- Full type-safety
- JSX in Markdown support
- Near perfect Lighthouse scores
- VS Code-like code highlighting with support for line numbers, line highlighting, words highlighting and inline code highlighting - powered by [Rehype Pretty Code](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/)
- Github flavoured Markdown support
- Separate pages for tags
- Table of contents with highlighting of current section in view
- Out-of-the-box SEO support
- Dynamic open-graph (OG) image generation for posts
- Automatic image optimisations using `next/image`
- Uses latest bleeding edge technologies (yes, it's a feature) and best practices (I hope so)

## Upcoming Features

- Views counter
- Cloudinary support

## Features Not Supported (yet)

- Comments
- Search blogs posts / tags
- Mermaid support
- Multiple author support
- Custom layout support

## Theme

Currently, I maintain two theme versions: `Slate` and `Stone`. You can make your own theme by customising and tweaking `config.css`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the starter template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schardev/nextjs-contentlayer-blog

# or using `gh`
gh repo clone schardev/nextjs-contentlayer-blog
```

2. Add site information and relevant data to `lib/siteConfig.ts`.
3. Add your blog posts to `content/blog` directory with proper front-matter (see the available fields [here](https://github.com/schardev/nextjs-contentlayer-blog/blob/main/schema/contentlayer/blog-post.ts))
4. Build and deploy

## Directory and File Structure

| Directory/File      | Notes                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/siteConfig.ts` | contains config related to the site itself      |
| `content/`          | directory where your MDX or Markdown file lives |
| `schema/`           | contains schema related files                   |

## Additional notes

The code blocks support everything [`rehype-pretty-code`](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/) supports, with an added bonus for file type icon too.

If you have worked with `next/image` before you know that working with external images is a pain in the ass as you have to manually inspect and pass width and height properties to the Image component. Sure you can use `fill` property but then you have to have a fixed aspect ratio and deal with z-indexes. However, as mentioned above, images are optimised by default, so you don't even need to pass width and height property explicitly for external images (**only works for static files**). It'll be automatically passed to the Image component which helps to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

Styling is mostly controlled via CSS variables so it's pretty easy to tweak and configure.

If you have any issues or feature requests then report them to the main repository.
