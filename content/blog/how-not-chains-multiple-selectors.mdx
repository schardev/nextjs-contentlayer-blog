In CSS rules, you normally select elements that you want to apply styles to and all matching elements get styled. Have you ever wanted to apply styles to only a few elements and exclude everything else? This is possible in CSS by using the `:not()` pseudo-class. In this post, we'll take brief look at CSS pseudo-classes, how the `:not()` pseudo-class works, and how it behaves when multiple selectors are passed as an argument.

## What are CSS pseudo-classes?

Before we get into `:not()`, let's take a quick look at CSS [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes). In CSS, you use selectors to select the elements you want to style. For example, you can select all `<li>` elements and apply the `aquamarine` color to them:

```css
/* Select and style all list items */
li {
  color: aquamarine;
}
```

Pseudo-classes are keywords that you add to a selector. They let you style elements based on matching conditions other than by matching class or ID. So, by using a pseudo-class such as [`:required`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:required), you can target a form element based on whether or not it is required. A pseudo-class such as [`:first-child`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-child) lets you select an element based on its position in the document tree. You can check out the complete list of [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) in CSS on MDN Web Docs.

One example of a commonly used pseudo-class is :visited that lets you style the links that have been visited by a user. This can be a neat way to also let users know the links they've already clicked.

```css
/* Select and style visited links */
a:visited {
  color: lightgreen;
}
```

## What is the :not() pseudo-class?

`:not()` is the negation pseudo-class that selects elements that match none of the specified selectors. So you use `:not()` to apply style to elements excluded by the specified selectors.

Let's look at an example. Say you want to select and style all `<code>` elements on a page, but you want to exclude these elements when they're inside section headings. You can do this by using the `:not()` pseudo-class like this:

```css
/* Style all code elements except those inside h2 elements */
code:not(h2 > code) {
  color: red;
}
```

As you can see, the `:not` keyword is added to the element selector (`<code>`) and the not selector (`h2 > code`) is passed as an argument.

## Negating a single selector

The [Selectors Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-selectors-3-20181106/) specification allowed only a single "simple selector" as an argument for :not(). So you could only style elements like this:

```css
:not(.item__cost) {
  font-family: "Montserrat";
}
```

In this example, all elements without the class `.item__cost` get the Montserrat font.

## Negating multiple selectors

With [Selectors Level 4](https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/selectors/#negation), you can specify a "complex selector" as an argument for `:not()` and also pass multiple complex selectors in a comma-separated "selector list". This is supported in browser versions starting from Chrome 88, Firefox 84, and Safari 9. Now you can use :not() like this:

```css
/* Compound selector */
input:not(:required) {
  color: #919191;
}
```

All `<input>` elements that are not required will be dark grey. You can also pass a comma-separated list like this:

```css
/* Compound selector */
input:not(:required, [type="button"]) {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

All `<input>` elements that are not required and are not buttons will have a blue background.

To learn more about the differences between simple selectors, compound selectors, complex selectors, and selector lists, check out the Structure of a selector section in CSS selectors on MDN Web Docs.

## Chaining multiple selectors

In CSS, when you want to apply the same style to multiple elements, you generally use a comma-separated selector list to group the selectors. This is illustrated below:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  font-family: helvetica;
}
```

Similarly, you can group several `:not()` declarations in a comma-separated list of selectors to apply the specified styles only to excluded matching elements. The result is a style that applies to any element excluded by the `:not()` selector.

Let's say we have a form where we want to style only the text fields that are editable. In the form in the example below, the field `Employed` is a menu option field, the `Employment Date` field has the type `date`, and the field `Country` has the attribute `readonly`. These are the fields that we want to exclude from styling and the ones we can target by using the `:not()` pseudo-class.

This is the HTML code for the above form where you can spot the attributes and type:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name" class="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="Enter your name" />

  <label for="emp" class="emp">Employed:</label>
  <select name="emp" id="emp" disabled>
    <option selected>No</option>
    <option>Yes</option>
  </select>

  <label for="empDate">Employment Date:</label>
  <input type="date" name="empDate" id="empDate" />

  <label for="country">Country:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="country"
    id="country"
    value="United States"
    readonly />

  <label for="resume">Resume:</label>
  <input type="file" name="resume" id="resume" />
</form>
```

The desired styling can be achieved by using the `:not()` pseudo-class as shown in the CSS below. The `lightyellow` background color applies to all `<input>` elements that do not have the `disabled` attribute or the `readonly` attribute or the type `date`. The result is the selection and styling of the fields `Name`, `Employed`, and `Resume`. Notice that even though the field `Employed` has the attribute `disabled`, it is not styled because it is a `<select>` element.

```css
input:not([disabled], [readonly], [type="date"]) {
  background-color: lightyellow;
  color: red;
}
```

This is how `:not()` chains the multiple selectors.

## Summary

To recap, use comma-separated selectors in the `:not()` pseudo-class to chain declarations for multiple selectors. I hope you found this post helpful.
